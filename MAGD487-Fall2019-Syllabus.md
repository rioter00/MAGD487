### Attendance & Student Expectations
Your presence in class is expected with excused absences being medical and family emergencies (such as a death in the family). You may have two unexcused absences without penalty, but beyond that you will lose 1/3 of a letter grade (A → A- → B+ → B → B- → C+, etc) from your final grade for each unexcused absence.

Please don't ask me what you missed. It is your responsibility to check Canvas, talk to other students, get notes, check announcements, etc.

Practice respect and empathy with others during discussions and activities.

Read/view/review any assigned media before class.

<b>Assignments are due by the start of class unless specified.</b> Projects may have different timeline and will be stated when project is assigned.

Late assignments are not accepted for full grading consideration, with two exceptions:
 1. 	If you’ve talked with me at least one day before the assignment is due and obtained consent to hand it in at a later date.
 2. 	If you have a medical or family emergency for which you can provide some evidence of having to miss class to attend to.

If neither of these requirements is satisfied, you may still turn in a late assignment. It’s grade potential decreases by 10% each day it is late. (e.g. 24 hours late or less - 90% maximum grade; 48 hours late or less - 80% max grade; etc)

Keep digital copies of all of your work for this class. This is for both your sake and mine. If I happen to misplace your work, it is up to you to supply me with a new copy of it. Short version: Backup your digital work, scan or photograph your handwritten work.


### How I Will Communicate With You
Email & D2L: Check it! You are responsible for checking the course D2L website for announcements on a daily basis.

### Media Caveat
This is a media-heavy class, and as such we will be using computers for a large portion of the assignments. However, during lecture, discussion, or student presentations you may not have laptops, smart phones or mobile phones in use.

### Academic Misconduct
Multimedia fluency and competence make it much easier to engage in academic misconduct. These technologies also provide professors with more sophisticated techniques for detecting misconduct. UWS policy in regard to misconduct is available online (http://www.uww.edu/handbook/student/#14).

All work that you turn in should be your own. This includes text, images, audio and information. When you use work that is the intellectual property of others, this material should be properly identified and cited using either MLA or APA style citations. If you neglect to do this, you will automatically fail the assignment. If you willfully plagiarize the work of others, you will fail the course.
