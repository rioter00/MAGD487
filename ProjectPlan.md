## Objectives
+ Produce plans for at least **two** portfolio-quality projects

## Procedure
1. Brainstorm a project that will expand your portfolio.
These projects may be created individually or as a group

2. This project is meant to expand your portfolio and showoff your current skill -- you must speak with the instructor prior to starting your project & this must not be your first attempt at it. Example: You can not make your first game as your final project. You can not make your first film as your final project. 

3. Each project plan must
	+	Be Digitally produced (Microsoft Word, Google Docs)
	+ Address stages of _weekly_ progress including:
		1. 'peer review' - Either Dec 1 or 8
		3. 'final' - Dec 15

	> *Example:*<br>
	> Week 1 - Research (tech, models, concept)<br>
	> Week 2 - sketches finished <br>
	> Week 3 - first prototype finished <br>
	> Week 4 - peer review and revisioning
	> Week 5 - final version complete


Plans for collaborative projects must address each collaborator's weekly check point.

		*Example:*
		Week 2:
		- Suzy: sketches finished
		- Johnny: character movement scripts finished
		- Malcolm: script finalized

Collaborative projects must address a collaboration tool for communication: [Trello](http://trello), GChat, [Asana](http://asana.com), [Slack](http://slack.com), [Facebook](http://messenger.com). **The instructor must be included in this tool.**

Collaborative projects may follow any collaborative project methodology.

Projects may run concurrently or consecutively.

You will bring this project plan in each week along with the project materials and [weekly writeup](WeeklyWriteup.md).
