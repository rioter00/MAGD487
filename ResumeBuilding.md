### Definition
> A resume is an evolving document that summarizes your qualifications for employment. It lets the reader know the type of position you seek, and highlights your education, experience, skills, and other related information. Ultimately, the goal of your resume is to generate a job interview.

1. "Evolving document" - you should constantly update your resume whenever relevant information changes.
2. The end goal is a job interview.

### Getting Started
Creating a resume is no small task because of the amount of relevant information. If you've never created one, below is a checklist to help you gather your information

#### General Information
- [ ] Name
- [ ] Address
- [ ] Email
- [ ] Phone Number
- [ ] Education (School, Major, Minor, GPA, timespan/graduation date)
- [ ] Honors, Awards
- [ ] Organizations
- [ ] Activities

#### Job Specific
- [ ] Related Experience *
- [ ] Related Skills, Qualifications, Proficiencies

#### Other
- [ ] Other Experience(s)
- [ ] Summary / Tag-line
- [ ] Objective

#### Your experience
When you write about your experience, use statements of accomplishment rather than just descriptions of role. Use action verbs when highlighting your experience. Be consistent with tense usage.  (http://hls.harvard.edu/dept/opia/job-search-toolkit/action-verbs/)

*Examples:*
- Directed effects team in X-Award-winning *That Shooter: Y*.
- Created animated cutscenes for MTV series *Betty & Bubkus*.
- Implemented cross-platform multiplayer servers for *Jupiter Horizon: Eventual Defeat*

Include the position, company, and timespan of previous experience.

Use active voice when highlighting experience.
*If you can add 'by zombies' at the end of a sentence, you are using passive voice.*

\* Some sources suggest using two sections 'Accomplishments' and 'Employment History', where the former highlights notable achievements (usually near the top of the resume).

#### Tailoring your resume
Your resume should be job-specific. If you are applying for a 2D background artist position, your private detective experience may be superfluous. Whether you choose to include them (2D art vs private detective experience) should depend on the job requirements.

#### Order
Now that you have the basic elements gathered, the order of the resume should be considered.

A general rule to follow is to have the most relevant information closer to the top of your resume.

Consider leading with relevant professional (or intern) experience if you have it.

If you recently graduated or are still in school, your most qualifying elements for the job may be your education.

#### Tips

- Proofread. Check your spelling and grammar.

- Have someone else to look at your resume.

- Do no use abbreviations.

- Be concise. Use bullet points to stay organized. Largers sections should not have bullets.
