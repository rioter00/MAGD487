## Objectives
+ Research effective portfolios
+ Research appropriate platforms to host portfolio content
+ Gather and curate MAGD projects
+ Build and publish a portfolio
+ Promote content on portfolio
+ Give and receive feedback through peer review

## Definition - Portfolio
> *A select collection of media created by an individual or groups of individuals, showcasing work to possibly attract employers and  clients, create a branding identity, increase visibility, and create a communications channel to followers.*

## Process
#### For the first half this semester you will work through this assignment. You will have meetings to progress with the instructor. Each stage will have materials that will be graded, with the expectation that having completed this sequence, you will have materials/media, layout, code/webpages, completed in the form of a live portfolio.

  > **How you will be graded**
  > At each step (almost), look for 'check in material' section. 
  > As you progress through this assignment, bring **all completed material to each check-in**. 
  > You will be graded on that material. 
  > While you may complete more than one step between check-ins, do not skip steps.

Do not begin work on this project until after you've completed the [Portfolio Research Assignment](PortfolioResearchAssignment.md).

1. Gather creative work
  - Locate and centralize creative work. If you are working with digital images, as you might have to resize these images, make sure you are working with duplicates/backups.

  > **Check-In Material**
  > - [ ] Bring a list of MAGD courses taken at UWW.
  > - [ ] Bring in all media that will be part of portfolio. This should be work created in the courses of MAGD courses (minimum) and other outside work.
  > - Having little or "nothing to show" or "lost everything" from previous courses will result in a low grade for this checkin. Do your due diligence by locating old media, search backups, and contacting past collaborators.

2. On paper, layout (sketches) your portfolio. Consider the following
  + style/theme (Layout, Typeface, Density, Linking to Project)
  + method of creation (HTML? Content Management System?)
  + chronology of elements
  + Other pages?

  Be prepared to answer these questions?
  + What types of media are you looking to highlight? How?

  > **Check-In Material**
  > - [ ] Bring sketches (ON PAPER) of your portfolio, showing layout, expected interactions.
  > - [ ] Show how the different types of media would look.
  > - [ ] Sketches should answer the follow questions:
  >   - [ ] What is the layout? Single Page? Multi-page?
  >   - [ ] How are images shown? Gallery? Carousel/Sliders? Accent image?
  > - [ ] Type-facing? Color Scheme? Logo/Icon?
  > - [ ] About Page?
  > - [ ] Blog Page? What would you blog about?

3. Clean up media and create artifacts of creative work (images, videos, descriptions).
  - [ ] When creating digital images, consider that a common width for websites is 960px. Is your portfolio mobile friendly? Responsive? How?
  - [ ] Create photographs of physical objects.
  - [ ] Record videos of gameplay, animations.
  - [ ] Resize/Crop images and videos.
  - [ ] Convert formats to conform with web standards.
  - [ ] Note that many Content Management Systems may automatically resize, crop, and edit photos. If you plan on writing your ```code```, note that you might have to create your thumbnails, etc.
  - [ ] Upload pertinant media to relevant Content Delivery Network. 

***
4. Write descriptions of individual artifacts and larger projects.
  - [ ] If grouping artifacts from a single project, a written description about the project (also known as case studies) give visitors insight on the project and process as a whole.
  - [ ] If you had a contributor/collaborator, be sure to credit them.
  
  - [ ] Write a short bio about yourself. Information about the work you create, relevant experience, and ways to contact you are important. 

  > **Check-In Material** 
  > - [ ] Bring all the formatted, converted, resized media.
  > - [ ] Bring in updated sketches.
  > - [ ] Bring written descriptions of projects/images/media/games.
  > - [ ] All media should be grouped and organized.
  > - [ ] Bring a short bio.
