# MAGD 487 - Portfolio Development Project 

[Part One](#part-one-200-points)

[Part Two](#part-two-150-points)

#### Part One: 200 points

## Objectives
+ Research effective portfolios
+ Research appropriate platforms to host portfolio content
+ Gather and curate MAGD projects
+ Build and publish a portfolio
+ Promote content on portfolio
+ Give and receive feedback through peer review

## Definition - Portfolio
> *A select collection of media created by an individual or groups of individuals, showcasing work to possibly attract employers and  clients, create a branding identity, increase visibility, and create a communications channel to followers.*

## Process
#### For the first half this semester you will working through this project, with meetings of progress with the instructor. Each stage will have expected materials that will be graded.

  > **How you will be graded**
  > At each step (almost), look for 'check in material' section. 
  > As you progress through this assignment, bring **all completed material to each check-in**. 
  > You will be graded on that material. 
  > While you may complete more than one step between check-ins, do not skip steps.

Do not begin work on this project until after you've completed the [Portfolio Research Assignment](PortfolioResearchAssignment.md).

1. Gather creative work
  - Locate and centralize creative work. If you are working with digital images, as you might have to resize these images, make sure you are working with duplicates/backups.

  > **Check-In Material**
  > - Bring a list of MAGD courses taken at UWW.
  > - Bring in all media that will be part of portfolio. This should be work created in the courses of MAGD courses (minimum) and other outside work.
  > - Having little or "nothing to show" or "lost everything" from previous courses will result in a low grade for this checkin. Do your due diligence by locating old media, search backups, and contacting past collaborators.

2. On paper, layout (sketches) your portfolio. Consider the following
  + style/theme (Layout, Typeface, Density, Linking to Project)
  + method of creation (HTML? Content Management System?)
  + chronology of elements
  + Other pages?

  Be prepared to answer these questions?
  + What types of media are you looking to highlight? How?

  > **Check-In Material**
  > - Bring sketches (ON PAPER) of your portfolio, showing layout, expected interactions.
  > - Show how the different types of media would look.
  > - Sketches should answer the follow questions:
  >   - What is the layout? Single Page? Multi-page?
  >   - How are images shown? Gallery? Carousel/Sliders? Accent image?
  > - How do you attain focus?
  > - Any particular type-facing?
  > - About Page?
  > - Blog Page? What would you blog about?

3. Clean up media and create artifacts of creative work (images, videos, descriptions).
  - When creating digital images, consider that a common width for websites is 960px.
  - Create photographs of physical objects.
  - Record videos of gameplay, animations.
  - Resize/Crop images and videos.
  - Convert formats to conform with web standards.
  - Note that many Content Management Systems may automatically resize, crop, and edit photos. If you plan on writing your ```code```, note that you might have to create your thumbnails, etc.

4. Write descriptions of individual artifacts and larger projects.
  - If grouping artifacts from a single project, a written description about the project (also known as case studies) give visitors insight on the project and process as a whole.
  - If had a contributor to work items, be sure to credit them.

  > **Check-In Material** (Steps 3 and 4)
  > - Bring all the formatted, converted, resized media.
  > - Bring in updated sketches.
  > - Bring written descriptions of projects/images/media/games.
  > - All media should be grouped and organized.

5. Create a webpage or Find a content management system. Examples below.
Research web hosts and services. Some may cost money. Signup for one and begin adding content and formatting. If are using a CMS and have well organized your materials, this stage may not take much time. Upload content, format page(s).
  - Examples of web content management systems.
    - https://www.behance.net (hosted)
    - https://carbonmade.com (hosted)
    - http://wordpress.com (hosted)
    - http://wordpress.org (self-hosted)
    - https://www.joomla.org (hosted)
    - https://www.joomla.org (self-hosted)
    - http://squarespace.com (self-hosted)
    - http://github.com (markdown possible, some restrictions)

  > **Check-In Material**
  > - Have the link to the live page(s).
  > - All linked media and pages should run and open. Dead links may result in lower evaluation. 

6. Prepare a presentation of your portfolio.
