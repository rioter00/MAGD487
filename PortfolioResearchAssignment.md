## Definition - Portfolio
> A select collection of media created by an individual or groups of individuals, showcasing work to possibly attract employers and  clients, create a branding identity, increase visibility, and create a communications channel to followers.

Portfolios are marketing and branding tools for creators and companies. They allow creators to showcase their work to visitors and attract possible clients/employers. Portfolios should be continuously updated and come in varying layouts depending on the work and media. Online portfolios can be made quickly with hosted services providing easy-to-setup templates.

The aspects of effective portfolio will be part of in-class discussion based on your research and incorporated into your own portfolio.
